Please create me an HTML formatted news brief summarizing these articles,
including citations. Don't be afraid to take your time. I really want the
format to be tidy. Follow the below format, my instructions to you are in [brackets]:

Here is a json array containing elements of news articles: <%= data.html_safe %>

The elements in the json array include these properties:
`"article_url"` contains the citation link for the article.
`"title"` contains the article title.
`"body"` contains the article body.



```HTML
<div class="intro">[Put a wish that this message finds me well, and explaining that you have brought me my daily news.]</div>
<ul>
  [for each element in the json array do]
  <li><strong>[Write a new brief title using the "title" and "body" and put it here.]: </strong>[Put the article summary here.] Source: [Put the News site name linking to the article here.]</li>
  [end for each]
</ul>
<span>[Put a witty quip about crafting a haiku for me especially. Try to be funny and pompous.]</span>
<div class="haiku">[Create a haiku here, each line separated by a <br> element, which summarizes what you think is important from all of this news, excluding any reference to violence.]</div>
```
